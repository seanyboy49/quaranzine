## "The quaranzine for the quaranzined"

[qrzn.org](https://qrzn.org/) is the brainchild of [JG Debray](https://jgdebray.com/), a designer based in New York. JG came up with the idea of an online magazine for him and other designers/artists/writers to provide commentary on the ongoing pandemic through different forms of media.

## The tech

The site itself is built on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), a [React](https://reactjs.org/)-based framework and static site generator that follows the principles of [JAM STACK](https://jamstack.org/).

Since all pages are generated at build-time, what results is a server side rendered app that is blazingly fast.

We used [react-responsive](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-responsive) to make the site responsive across different devices and deployed the app to [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), a fantastic platform for building and hosting web applications.
